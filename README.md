## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) - Modular and accessible React component library

### What I learned

I have learned how to use the chakra library to import some of its components and include them in my React application, how to customize my application's theme, assign styles to each component according to its usage rules. This tool has been great.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my learning of React and Chakra, in terms of implementing best development practices and planning tests for application modules.
